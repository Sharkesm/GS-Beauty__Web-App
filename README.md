# GS-Beauty Web-App

Global styling is an international designer hair salon. The company started out from a small hairdressing business in London, UK and has built up a clientele of the rich and famous. 

As well as the salon in London, they now also have a French salon in Paris and a salon in the USA in New York City. All the salons offer the very best in hair styling to a set of sophisticated customers. The salon owner, Heather, has decided that it is time to enter the digital age and has asked for your help. You have been commissioned by GlobalStyling to produce a web-based application that will enable customers to book appointments in the 
three salons. 

The Global styling appointments system  allows users to create a record for themselves and then log in to the system to book an appointment at one of the three salons in London, Paris or New York. The system will store personal details of each customer and their email address so that they can be sent details of new hair treatments and special offers. 

As the owner, Heather needs the ability to create a list of products (hair stylings and treatments) and the prices of these products in local currency (pounds, euros, and dollars). There also needs to be the facility to modify or delete products. 
In addition, she also needs to be able to produce a list of appointments at each salon for any given week or on any given day. 

Customers will need to be able to create an account and log into the system with their details. Having done so they will be presented with an interface that allows them to:

- Select a salon to visit from the three location between London, Paris and New York.

- View the hair stylings and treatments available at that salon and the prices should be presented in local currency.

- Book an appointment for a hair styling or treatment, and receive a confirmation email.

- Proceed with online payment (Future feature) only cash on delivery is available at the moment.
